Planetary Models
----------------

This utility helps to  produces a grid of models of planetary transmission spectra using the software petitRADTRANS (https://petitradtrans.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The computation of the models is done in parallel.

This is part of my research assistance work at Universidad de Antofagasta, under the supervision of Dr. Jeremy Tregloan-Reed.
